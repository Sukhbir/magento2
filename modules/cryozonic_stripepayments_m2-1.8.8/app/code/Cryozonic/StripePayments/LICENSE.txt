# Single Use / Single Domain License (SUSDL)

## Terminology

Terminology

A Store refers to a Magento store as configured from the merchant's Magento installation from the admin area, under System > Manage Stores, and is configured to use a single Magento Root Category.

A Product refers to any software created by Cryozonic Ltd, a UK registered company with registration number 07753199 (thereafter refered to as Cryozonic).

A Domain Name, thereafter refered to as the Domain, refers to a Top Level Domain (TLD). For example, if your website is http://www.proteinbars.com/shop/, then your licensed Domain is proteinbars.com. Any subdomains of the Domain, for example uk.proteinbars.com or it.proteinbars.com which target different language markets but are used as part of the same Store are included in the Domain license. Furthermore, any country code TLDs (ccTLDs) with the same name as the Domain, for example www.proteinbars.co.uk (United Kingdom) or www.proteinbars.com.au (Australia) and which also point to the same Store for the sole purpose of segmenting the market by language are also included in the Domain license.

A Production Domain or Live Domain refers to a Domain Name that is publicly available online and is used by a merchant to accept orders from its customers and charge their cards for those orders.

A Development Domain, Testing Domain or Staging Domain refers to any other hosted Magento setup that is not a Production Domain and is primarily used by the merchant's developers to develop the Production Domain.
